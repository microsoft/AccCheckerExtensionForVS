# Accessibility Checker Extension for Visual Studio

The Tenon HTML Accessibility Checker makes it easier for Visual Studio developers to detect and resolve common accessibility issues with their HTML-based user interfaces. It takes more than static code analysis to create great experiences for people with permanent or situational disabilities. However, there is no reason to ship code with accessibility issues that can be detected automatically. This checker is one of many tools designed to help developers ship better code.

## Contribute

There are many way to contribute to this project:
* Submit new features or fixes (see "Legal stuff" below).
* Submit bugs and verify fixes that are checked in.
* Review source code changes.
* Engage other contributors.
* Comment on the relevant Visual Studio Blog.
* Review the solution in the Visual Studio Gallery.


## Please leverage the code!

Leverage the code to create new projects. We implemented some interesting features in this solution including:
* Implementing the browser link extension to exchange information between Visual Studio and multiple browsers (so that we can evaluate dynamic HTML rather than raw code)
* Implementing context-specific menu options on the Visual Studio Solution Explorer
* Integrating a RESTful service with Visual Studio
* Integrating results directly into the Visual Studio Error List

We published this source under an MIT liscense so that you can leverage any of these patterns.
